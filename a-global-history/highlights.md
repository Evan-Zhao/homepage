1. **The three turning points of life events on this planet**

   > Viewed In the broadest perspective, this development represents the second major turning point in the course of events on this planet.
   >
   > The first occurred when life originated out of inorganic matter. After that momentous step, all living forms evolved by adapting to their environments through mutation and natural selection. That is, the genes adapted to the environment, as was evident during the climatic upheavals of the Pleistocene.
   >
   > But with the appearance of humans, the evolutionary process was reversed. No longer did genes adapt to environment; instead, humans adapted by changing the environment to suit their genes. 
   >
   > Today, a third epochal turning point appears imminent as humans' growing knowledge of the structure and function of genes may soon enable them modify their genes as well as their environment.

2. **Culture is a way of dealing with environment without mutations**

   The other way is mutations of course -- the one method that was given to all species; also (perhaps soon) we'll have a third way of doing so, by genetic editing.

   These correspond to the *three major phases of life events* above.

   > Humans, and only humans, have been able to create a made-to-order environment, or culture, as it is called. 
   >
   > The reason is that only humans can symbolize, or envision things and concepts divorced from here-and-now reality. Only humans laugh, and only they know that they will die. Only they have wondered about the universe and its origins, about their place in it and in the hereafter.
   >
   > With these unique and revolutionizing abilities, humans have been able to cope with their environment without mutations. Human culture became the new, nonbiological way of having fur in the arctic, water storage in the desert, and fins in the water.
   >
   > More concretely, culture consists of tools, clothing, ornaments, institutions, language, art forms, and religious beliefs and practices. All these have served to adapt humans to their physical environment and to their fellow humans. ...

3. **Paleolithic social relation is cooperative and communal ... with reasons**

   "So the equality of our Paleolithic ancestors was *not due to superior morals*. Greed was absent because *nobody could profit from it*."

   > ... Since they were always on the move, no members could gain by accumulating more than others. They would only have to leave everything behind when the band moved to the next campsite after having exhausted local food resources.
   >
   > So the equality of our Paleolithic ancestors was not due to superior morals. Greed was absent because nobody could profit from it.

4. **Primitive humans and the supernatural**

   - Static, ahistorical views
   - Creation myths
   - Not able to naturalistically explain phenomena

   > ... primitive humans were basically *ahistorical* and *non-evolutionary* in their attitudes toward themselves and their society. They assumed that the future would be identical to the present, as the present was to the past.
   >
   > Consequently there was *no notion of change*, and hence *no inclination to criticize or to tamper with* existing institutions and practices. To their way of thinking, everything, including themselves, their culture, and their habitat, had appeared with the creation and was destined to continue unaltered into the future. The creation myths of hunting peoples are strikingly similar, involving heroes who fashioned the landscape, stocked it with game, brought forth the people, and taught them the arts and their customs.
   >
   > Not knowing how to cope with nature by naturalistic means, they had to resort to the supernatural. They turned to magic and spent much time in efforts to persuade or fool nature into yielding a greater abundance.

5. **All modern races stem from a common stock**

   > All modern races, then, stem from a common stock, and after it had attained its full human development. This explains why the Europeans were able to interbreed with all races in all the lands they discovered. It also explains why, as virtually all anthropologists agree, there are . Representatives of late Paleolithic or of the contemporary Australian aborigines would stand as much chance of graduating from a university as would representatives of any other living races.
