I am a 2nd-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](illinois.edu).

I am co-advised by [Prof. Sasa Misailovic](http://misailo.web.engr.illinois.edu/) and [Prof. Vikram S. Adve](https://vikram.cs.illinois.edu/).

My research interest is in programming languages, currently focusing on approximate computing, compiler stack for heterogeneous computing, and a mindful blend of both.
